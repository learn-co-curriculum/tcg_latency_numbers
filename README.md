# Latency Numbers Every Programmer Should Know

## Learning Goals

- Recognize the latency contributions of different levels of the computing stack

## Introduction

We want computers to feel fast. As engineers, we learn lots of tricks and cheats for speeding things up (or at least making them _feel_ like they are sped up).

In order to reason effectively about _why a program is slow_, you need to have some background knowledge about computers. In particular, you need to have an intutition for how fast different operations will take.

[Latency Numbers Every Programmer Should Know](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~rcs/research/interactive_latency.html) is an interactive explorer of the latency of different operations over time. It can help you answer questions like "How long did it take to send a packet around the world in 1995?"

At this point, many of the terms on this page are still mysterious to you. Your task is to demystify the jargon on this page using google and wikipedia, until you can
